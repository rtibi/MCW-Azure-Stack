# Azure Stack before the hands-on lab setup guide 

## Requirements

-   Microsoft Azure subscription 

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 6-7 hours

To execute this lab, you will have two options: you can use your own Azure Stack Development Kit that is already installed, or you will need to follow the instructions below to setup your own in Microsoft Azure using nested virtual machines.

For help with installation of the Azure Stack Development Kit, review the following article: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/development-kit>.

### Task 1: Create a virtual machine to execute the lab

1.  Launch a browser, and navigate to <https://github.com/opsgility/cw-azure-stack> and click the **Deploy to Azure** button.

2.  Specify a resource group name **AzureStack** and deploy the template.

    > **Note:** Please wait for the virtual machine to be provisioned prior to moving to the next step.

3.  After the VM is provisioned, **connect** to establish a new Remote Desktop Session.

4.  Depending on your Remote Desktop Protocol Client and browser configuration, you will either be prompted to open an RDP file, or you will need to download it and then open it separately to connect.

5.  Log in with the credentials specified during creation:

    -   User: **administrator**

    -   Password: **demo\@pass123**

6.  You will be presented with a Remote Desktop Connection warning because of a certificate trust issue. Click **Yes** to continue with the connection.

    ![Screenshot of the Remote Desktop Connection warning dialog box.](images/Setup/image3.png)

7.  When logging on for the first time, you will see a prompt on the right asking about network discovery. Click **No**.

    ![Screenshot of the Network discovery prompt, with the No button selected.](images/Setup/image4.png)

8.  Notice that Server Manager opens by default. On the left, click **Local Server**.

    ![Local Server is selected in the Server Manager menu.](images/Setup/image5.png)

9.  On the right side of the pane, click **On** by **IE Enhanced Security Configuration**.

10. Change to **Off** for Administrators and click **OK**.

    ![In the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration dialog box, Administrators is set to Off.](images/Setup/image7.png)

11. Launch Internet Explorer, and right click at the top of the browser and check Menu bar. Then open Tools -\> Internet Options -\> Security -\> Custom Level. Change File download to **Enable**.

    ![Under Downloads, File download is set to Enable.](images/Setup/image8.png)

### Task 2: Install the Azure Stack Developer Kit

1.  Launch an elevated PowerShell console and execute the following commands:

    ```powershell
    cd C:\AzureStackOnAzureVM

    .\Install-ASDK.ps1
    ```

    When prompted enter:

    -   Password for administrator: **demo\@pass123**

    -   Enter Azure AD User: Specify your Azure subscription user account.

    -   Select ASK Version **1808** and press **C** to continue.

2.  It will take up to 6 hours to successfully install the Azure Stack developer kit.

3.  After the installation reboots the virtual machine, login to the AzSHost-1 virtual machine using RDP to monitor the installation progress. You will need to use the account:

    -   Username: **azurestack.local\\azurestackadmin**

    -   Password: **\[your Azure Stack password\]**

4.  Once connected open Server Manager. On the left, click **Local Server**.  

    > **Note:** Wait until installation is complete.

### Task 3: Install PowerShell for Azure Stack

1.  Using your LABVM connect to your Azure Stack Host using RDP. You will need to use the account:

    -   Username: **azurestack.local\\azurestackadmin**

    -   Password: **\[your Azure Stack password\]**

2.  Open PowerShell ISE as an administrator. You will need to **right-click the link** on the start menu, click **More**, and **Run as administrator**.

    ![The Windows PowerShell ISE right-click sub-menus display.](images/Setup/image9.png)

3.  Click **Yes** when prompted.

    ![User Account Control is set to Yes.](images/Setup/image10.png)

4.  On the PowerShell ISE window, open the script pane by clicking the **\>** mark next to the word **Script**.

    ![Screenshot of the PowerShell Administrators window with the Script down arrow called out.](images/Setup/image11.png)

5.  Execute the following command to trust the PSGallery repository:

    ```powershell
    Register-PSRepository -Default
    Set-PSRepository -Name "PSGallery" -InstallationPolicy Trusted
    ```
    
    > **Note**: If you are using the VM from the suggested template, the repository is already registered and you will receive an error that you can ignore.

6.  Next, execute the following command to remove any previous versions of Azure PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    Get-Module -ListAvailable | where-Object {$_.Name -like "Azure*"} | Uninstall-Module
    ```

    > **Note**: If you see any errors you can safely ignore them.

7.  Remove any folders in the following folder that begin with Azure (if any).

    ```
    C:\Users\AzureStackAdmin\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
    ```

8.  Finally, execute the following command to install the Azure Stack PowerShell cmdlets:

    ```powershell
    # Install the AzureRM.Bootstrapper module. Select Yes when prompted to install NuGet

    Install-Module -Name AzureRm.BootStrapper

    # Install and import the API Version Profile required by Azure Stack into the current PowerShell session.

    Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile 2017-03-09-profile -Force

    Install-Module -Name AzureStack -RequiredVersion 1.4
    ```

### Task 4: Download the Latest Azure Stack Tools

1.  Using the previous elevated PowerShell console execute the following commands to download and extract the Azure Stack tools from GitHub.

    ```powershell
    # Change directory to the root directory.

    cd \

    # Download the tools archive.

    [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12

    invoke-webrequest https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools/archive/master.zip -OutFile master.zip

    # Expand the downloaded files.

    expand-archive master.zip -DestinationPath .  -Force

    # Change to the tools directory.

    cd AzureStack-Tools-master
    ```
    
### Task 5: Register Azure Stack with Azure AD

In this task, execute all the commands from an elevated PowerShell console on the Azure Stack host.

1.  CD to the registration folder of the AzureStack-Tools-master folder.

    ```powershell
