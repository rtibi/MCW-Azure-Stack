# Azure Stack hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

This workshop is designed to teach attendees how to design a hybrid cloud architecture using a combination of the Azure public cloud and Azure Stack. This functional architecture will enable customers to leverage their investments in Azure as a "cloud platform," rather than Azure as a "place." Attendees will learn to determine which systems are good candidates for the Azure public cloud and which are better suited on Azure Stack.

After completing workshop, attendees will be better able to recommend and design hybrid cloud systems that leverage one application and deployment model: Azure.

In addition, attendees will learn to:

-   Understand when the Azure public cloud versus Azure Stack is appropriate based on customer requirements.

-   Describe possible integrations between Azure public cloud solutions and Azure Stack

-   Understand the taxonomy of Azure Stack: tenants, regions, subscriptions, offers, plans, services and quotas.

-   Describe the resource providers that are available for use with Azure Stack

-   Design and deploy hybrid connectivity between Azure public cloud and Azure Stack.

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will deploy the Azure Stack Development Kit and deploy the SQL Database and Azure App Service resource providers as well as download several virtual machine images from the Azure Stack Marketplace. From there, you will implement a full taxonomy in Azure Stack consisting of a region, subscription, plan, offer, and quotas. After Azure Stack is configured, you will then deploy Azure SQL Database, Web and API apps and then deploy the Contoso application.

## Solution architecture

## Requirements

-   Microsoft Azure subscription 


## Exercise 1: Configure Azure Stack

Duration: 2-3 hours

In this exercise, you will configure the Azure Stack environment for the lab. You will install the resource providers for Azure SQL Database and Azure App Service, from there you will configure the taxonomy for the Azure Stack hands-on lab.

Tip: To minimize prompts from PowerShell, set your execution policy to bypass

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser

### Task 1: Deploy the Azure Stack App Service Resource Provider

#### Sub Task 1: Download the Installer and Scripts

1.  Download the installer executable from <https://aka.ms/appsvconmasinstaller> and helper scripts zip file from <https://aka.ms/appsvconmashelpers> to the **C:\\HOL\\** folder on the Azure Stack Host. The following files and folder structure appear after extracting the helper scripts zip:

    ![Screenshot of Azure Stack Host File Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image24.png "Azure Stack Host File Explorer")

The following screenshot shows the installer executable:

![In the Azure Stack Host File Explorer, a callout points to the AppService executable.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image25.png "Azure Stack Host File Explorer")

#### Sub Task 2: Create App Service Scripts

1.  Change to the **AppServiceHelperScripts** folder by executing the following command in an elevated PowerShell console:

    ```
    CD C:\HOL\AppServiceHelperScripts
    ```

2.  Create certificates that the Azure App service resource provider will need by running the following command:

    ```
    .\Create-AppServiceCerts.ps1
    ```

When prompted use the following values:

-   .pfx password use **demo\@pass123**

-   DomainName: **local.azurestack.external**

    The script creates four certificates in the C:\\HOL\\AppServiceHelperScripts folder. The four certificates created by this script are shown in the following table:

  |    |            |
|----------|:-------------:|
| **File name** | **Use** |
| \_.appservice.local.azurestack.external.pfx  | App Service default SSL certificate |
| Api.appservice.local.azurestack.external.pfx | App Service API SSL certificate |
| ftp.appservice.local.azurestack.external.pfx | App Service publisher SSL certificate |
| Sso.appservice.local.azurestack.external.pfx | App Service identity application certificate |

  
3.  Get the Azure Stack Root Certificate by executing the following command:
    ```
    .\Get-AzureStackRootCert.ps1
    ```

**When prompted:**

-   PrivilegedEndpoint: AzS-ERCS01

-   User name: azurestack\\cloudadmin

-   Password: demo\@pass123

#### Sub Task 3: Deploy Supporting File Server

**Note:** Azure App Service requires the use of a file server. You will use an ARM template to create a standalone file server for App Service.

1.  Launch the Azure Stack Administration portal if it isn't open.

2.  Deploy the template to the Azure Stack portal by clicking New and search for **Template Deployment**, click the result and then click the **Create button**. Within the new template deployment blade click **Edit Template**.

3.  Within the Edit Template blade, click **Quickstart template**, and then in the dropdown list choose **appservice-fileservice-standalone**, click **OK** and then **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the Edit template blade with the previouslyly mentioned selections.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image26.png "Edit template blade")

4.  Specify **demo\@pass123** for the three password parameters.

    ![In the Azure Stack - Administration window, under Custom deployment, Edit parameters is selected. Under Parameters, the parameters display.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image27.png "Azure Stack - Administration window")

5.  Use **AzSHOLFS** as the new resource group name and click **Create**. It may take 10-15 minutes to complete provisioning.

**NOTE:** The ARM template automatically creates the local users needed for the App Service Resource Provider.

6.  After the template deployment is complete, open the new virtual machine from clicking on **Virtual Machines, FileServerVM** and Note the Public IP address/DNS name label for later reference

    ![The Public IP address is called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image28.png "Public IP address")

7.  Connect to the new file server virtual machine by clicking **Virtual Machines**, **FileServerVM**, and then **Connect** and login using the following credentials

    -   User: fileshareowner

    -   Password: demo\@pass123

        ![Virtual machines button screenshot](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image29.png "Virtual machines button")

        ![Connect button screenshot](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image30.png "Connect button")

8.  Next you need to provision the content share on the file server. Launch an elevated console from within the VM by opening the run dialog and entering **cmd** then pressing **enter**, and then execute the following commands.
    ```
    set WEBSITES_SHARE=WebSites

    set WEBSITES_FOLDER=C:\WebSites

    md %WEBSITES_FOLDER%

    net share %WEBSITES_SHARE% /delete

    net share %WEBSITES_SHARE%=%WEBSITES_FOLDER% /grant:Everyone,full

    ```

    9.  Next up is to configure access control to the shares. To configure access run the following commands at an elevated command prompt on the file server. Replace values in italics with values that are specific to your environment.

    ```
    set WEBSITES_FOLDER=C:\WebSites

    icacls %WEBSITES_FOLDER% /reset

    icacls %WEBSITES_FOLDER% /grant FileShareOwner:(OI)(CI)(F)

    icacls %WEBSITES_FOLDER% /inheritance:r

    icacls %WEBSITES_FOLDER% /grant FileShareUser:(CI)(S,X,RA)

    icacls %WEBSITES_FOLDER% /grant *S-1-1-0:(OI)(CI)(IO)(RA,REA,RD)
    ```

    ![Screenshot of the Hyper-V Manager.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image53.png "Hyper-V Manager ")

3.  In the bottom pane of Hyper-V Manager, you will see the **AzS-ERCS01** VM with four tabs. Click the **Networking** Tab. Then, take note of the IPv4 address. In the case of the example it is **192.168.200.225**.

    ![In the AzS-ERCS01 pane, the IP Address is called out, and the Networking tab is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image54.png "AzS-ERCS01 pane")

4.  From the Azure Stack Host, open a new Internet Explorer tab and connect to the follow address.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-sql-resource-provider-deploy

5.  From this webpage, download the version of the SQL Resource Provider that matches your version of Azure Stack.

    ![The SQL Resource Provider version link is selected in the Azure Stack build section.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image55.png "Azure Stack build section")

6.  Once it is downloaded, using Windows Explorer on the Azure Stack Host, navigate to your downloads directory. Double click the file to install the package. You will need to click **Run** at the Security Warning prompt.

    ![In the File Explorer Downloads folder, the install package is called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image56.png "File Explorer")

    ![The Open File - Security Warning box displays with the Run button selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image57.png "Open File - Security Warning box")

7.  Click **Accept** and use the **Browse** and **Make New Folder** buttons to change the destination folder to a new folder named: **C:\\HOL\\AzureStackSQLRP.** Click **Extract**.

    ![The WinRAR self-extracting archive page displays with a callout pointing to the Destination folder field, and the Browse and Extract buttons selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image58.png "WinRAR self-extracting archive page")

8.  From the elevated PowerShell console, move to the directory where you extracted the SQL RP files: **C:\\HOL\\AzureStackSQLRP**
    ```
    cd C:\HOL\AzureStackSQLRP
    ```

9.  Move back to your Azure Stack Admin portal and check on the download of Windows Server 2016 Datacenter -- Server Core. **This must be downloaded prior to continuing.** If for some reason the download is not complete, you must wait until the image is in the Azure Stack Marketplace prior to moving forward. This is due to the SQL RP using this image.

10. From this directory, run the script DeploySQLProvider.ps1 by executing the following command.
    ```
    .\DeploySQLProvider.ps1
    ```

![Command screenshot.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image59.png "Command")
